#Timers#

#PROBLEMS:#
- gameOver calls stopClock and that's a problem, because clicking reset doesn't run gameOver
- DONE: Add contrast background to score panel
- Should stars be going up or down?
- re-read rubric
- add flash animation to red no-match
- The clock and star timers don't exactly match up. That's fixable.
- I haven't cleared all of my timers! There's still the flipdown timer
- Add a design to the back of the cards
