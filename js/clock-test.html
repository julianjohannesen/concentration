<!-- This HTML snippet allowed me to test a couple of different approaches to the clock which shows the player's time. I stared out using setTimeout, but eventually switched to setInterval. It's more reliable than setTimeout as more closely approaches "real" time.-->

        <div class="rating-box">
            <!-- This is part of a failed experiment in various methods for creating a star rating system. Most of the tutorials one finds on this subject have to do with creating a system that allows the user to hover and then click on a star rating. Some of them use table markup, others use divs exclusively. Most rely on icon fonts, but not all. The method that interested me most used a masking effect in which one set of solid stars overlays a set of star outlines. The width the of the overlay could then be adjusted with a class to "fill" the underlying star outlines. I ended up not really liking this approach. It just seems inelegant. I explored CSS solutions using some for sort of masking or clipping effect, but didn't get far. -->
