## About Star Wars Concentration

Star Wars Concentration began as a project in Udacity's Front-End Web Developement Nanodegree program. The original project provided some html and css and asked students to supply the JavaScript necessary to create a version of the popular card game "concentration."

The project provided an opportunity for students to use DOM manipulation techniques, timers, regular expressions, and several other technologies in a practical application. 

My own project went a bit further than was required by the project rubric, including a rework of the CSS to make it much more responsive using technologies like the vmin unit of measure and CSS grid. 

The Star Wars theme was a fun twist on an otherwise bland matching game.
